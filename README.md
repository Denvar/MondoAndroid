# MondoAndroid

An Android app for [Mondo](https://getmondo.co.uk/)

## Configuration
If you have developer access to the Mondo API you can create a non-confidental auth client in the developer console. 
Then, update the [config file](https://github.com/joluet/MondoAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/tech/jonas/mondoandroid/api/Config.java) with your auth client details and you're ready to go.

## Build Instructions
Just use the gradle wrapper to build the app: `$ ./gradlew assembleDebug`
